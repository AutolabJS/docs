# Writing Tests

* Copy the sample [repository structure](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/tree/9be29e3445f841247e6412a66c1bc9839fec124d/Test)
* Remove `student_solution`.
* `execute.sh`, `Driver.java` should not be changed under any circumstances.
* `test_cases/`, `info_file.txt` should have the same format as followed in the files in the sample link.
* Test only one class in each test case.
* While writing a test case i.e. in a class called `Test` in `test_cases/Test<test_no>.java` in function `public int test()`, check only for the correctness of a value and return the marks. All other cases will be handled by the framework.
* Add a new line corresponding to the test in `info_file.txt`. The first parameter is the test file, followed by the class to be tested and the timelimit in seconds. 
* The pushed code should have only `author_solution/`, `test_cases/`, `Driver.java`, `execute.sh`, `info_file.txt` as in the sample link.

# Procedure
* Push the testing code to GitLab in repository `lab_author/<lab_name>`
* Push the skeleton code and lab question PDF to GitLab in repository `lab_author/lab_source/` in directory `<lab_name>`
* After pushing the code, open the `labs.json` file in the main server.
* Add a new JSON entry in the Labs array which should be identical to this:  
`
   {
      "Lab_No": "1",
      "start_date": "2",
      "start_month": "4",
      "start_year": "2016",
      "start_hour": "3",
      "start_minute": "00",
      "end_date": "12",
      "end_month": "4",
      "end_year": "2016",
      "end_hour": "22",
      "end_minute": "00",
      "hard_date": "12",
      "hard_month": "4",
      "hard_year": "2016",
      "hard_hour": "23",
      "hard_minute": "10",
      "penalty": "10"
    }`

* Restart the web server.

# Example
* Download skeleton directory for a lab testing framework from [code base](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/tree/9be29e3445f841247e6412a66c1bc9839fec124d/Test) 
* Login to GitLab with user account `lab_author`
* Create a repo as `<lab_name>`. For example `lab1`.
* Clone this repo to your local machine.
* Move the downloaded code to this repo directory.
* Remove the `student_solution/` directory.
* Put the lab solution in `author_solution`.
* `execute.sh`, `Driver.java` should not be changed under any circumstances.
* `test_cases/`, `info_file.txt` should have the same format as followed in the files in the sample link.
* Test only one class in each test case.
* For each test case, create a class called `Test` in `test_cases/Test<test_no>.java` in function `public int test()`. For example - `Test1.java` should have a class called `Test`. `Test` will have a function `public int test()`.
* Check only for the correctness of a value and return the marks. All other cases will be handled by the framework. For example - if a test case is worth 2 marks, make relevant class objects and check for the correct answers using if statements. In all correct scenario, return 2 otherwise return 0. Check Test1.java in the sample repo. Don't worry about compilation errors, runtime errors/exceptions or infinite loops. These will be handled automatically.
* Add a new line corresponding to the test in `info_file.txt`. The first parameter is the test file, followed by the class to be tested and the timelimit in seconds. For example, if the class you are testing is `Seller.java` in test case 1 then the corresponding entry will look like this for a `1 second` time limit. - `Test1.java Seller.java 1`. See `info_file.txt` in the sample repo for more clarity.
* Repeat above three points for as many test cases as you want.
* By now you will have the following files `author_solution/`, `test_cases/`, `Driver.java`, `execute.sh`, `info_file.txt` as in the sample link.
* Push this code to GitLab. Your testing repo is ready.
* Put any skeleton code and lab question PDF in a repo `lab_source` with `<lab_name>` as the subdirectory. For example, `lab_source/lab1`.
* After performing the two pushes, open the `labs.json` file in the main server.
* Add a new JSON entry in the Labs array which should be identical to this:  
`
   {
      "Lab_No": "lab1",
      "start_date": "2",
      "start_month": "4",
      "start_year": "2016",
      "start_hour": "3",
      "start_minute": "00",
      "end_date": "12",
      "end_month": "4",
      "end_year": "2016",
      "end_hour": "22",
      "end_minute": "00",
      "hard_date": "12",
      "hard_month": "4",
      "hard_year": "2016",
      "hard_hour": "23",
      "hard_minute": "10",
      "penalty": "10"
    }`

* Restart the web server.
