NOTE:    
1. Here you are setting up the evaluation for HackerRank kind of I/O equivalence testing.
1. Please have your testcases, ie, inputs and outputs ready before you begin the solution setup on AutolabJS.    
    Name your testcases as per the following convention.    
    

    | Test Number   | Input file name  | Output file name |
    |------- |:-------:|:--------:|
    | Test1    | input00.txt | output00.txt |
    | Test2    | input01.txt | output01.txt |
    | Test3    | input02.txt | output02.txt |



### Setup Solution ###

Setup of a matching gitlab repository is mandatory before a lab evaluation is setup on AutolabJS. Please follow the steps given below to create and setup a lab solution on gitlab.

1. **Gitlab Login**    
    Login to gitlab as `lab_author`. In case you have not created an account with username of `lab_author` before, please do so before going to the next step.

1. **Create repository**    
    Create a gitlab repository for the lab. You can create a new gitlab repository by clicking on _New Project_ button. After successful creation of a project repository, Gitlab creates a URL for the project.    
    For example, `lab1` of `lab_author` hosted at `https://autolab.bits-goa.ac.in` shall have a URL of `https://autolab.bits-goa.ac.in/lab_author/lab1`

1. **Clone repository**    
    Clone the gitlab repository onto your local machine.
    ```shell
    $ export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1
    $ git clone https://lab_author@autolab.bits-goa.ac.in/lab_author/lab1.git
    ```
    This step clones the gitlab repository into _lab1_ directory of the present working directory.

1. **Copy evaluation skeleton**    
    You can copy the contents of sample directory structure in [io_tests](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/tree/master/docs/examples/io_tests) into your repository. Remove the `student_solution` sub-directory and the READMEs. A brief explanation of the contents of the directory follows. 
   ```shell
    test_cases/                 ---> contains testcases to be run against submitted code
        /checks                 ---> any sample input / output text files to be used for evaluation
        /c                      ---> test cases for C language (DON'T CHANGE THIS)
        /cpp                    ---> test cases for C++ language (DON'T CHANGE THIS)
        /cpp14                  ---> test cases for C++ 2014 language (DON'T CHANGE THIS)
        /python2                ---> test cases for Python2 language (DON'T CHANGE THIS)
        /python3                ---> test cases for Python3 language (DON'T CHANGE THIS)
        /java/                  ---> test cases for Java language (DON'T CHANGE THIS)
            /setup              ---> compile, execute and test-setup bash shell scripts (DON'T CHANGE THIS)
                compile.sh      ---> script to compile the code for each test (DON'T CHANGE THIS)
                executeTest.sh  ---> script to execute the code for each test (DON'T CHANGE THIS)
                Test1.sh        ---> script to complete first test (calls compile.sh, executeTest.sh) (DON'T CHANGE THIS)
                (one script for each test case)
  
    (one language-specific sub-directory exists under test_cases)

    execute.sh                  ---> orchestrating script for one submission (DON'T CHANGE THIS)
    test_info.txt               ---> text file containing an enumeration of all tests to be run
   ```
    You can evaluate C, C++ 2011, C++ 2014, Python2, and Python3 languages.

1. **Replace I/O Files**    
    Delete the contents of `test_cases/checks` directory and place your input and output text files there. These files must strictly follow the naming conventions suggested at the top of the page.

1. **Evaluation Setup**    
    Apart from the above directory structure, when the evaluation happens three more directories are created by AutolabJS. They are:
    ```shell
    student_solution        ---> the submitted code gets copied here
    working_dir             ---> a temporary directory used during evaluation
    results                 ---> results of evaluation are stored in this directory
        /log.txt            ---> evaluation log is in this file
        /scores.txt         ---> scores received for all the test cases
        /comments.txt       ---> comments received for all the test cases
    ```

1. **Create List of Tests**    
    Copy `test_info.txt` from [io_tests](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/tree/master/docs/examples/io_tests) and modify to suit your needs. Each line of `test_info.txt` has two fields separated by a tab space. A sample `test_info.txt` with two tests is shown below.        
    ```shell
    Test1	1
    Test2	1
    ```
    The first field corresponds to name of the test and the second field corresponds to time limit to run the test. The last line ends without any new line character.
    **The given setup supports upto 10 tests.**

1. **Additional Tests**    
    Adding more tests would require additional Test.sh scripts in all the language setup directories (for Java, the directory is `test_cases/java/setup`).

1. **save and export the solutions to gitlab**    
    Make a commit in the local repository and push the changes to the gitlab.    
    ```shell
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m 'instructor's solutions'
    $ git push origin master
    ```

1. Follow the details provided on [Manage Course](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/wiki/v0.2.0-Manage-Course) page to add the lab to website.
