NOTE:    
1. Please have your solution ready before you begin the solution setup on AutolabJS.
1. For the sake of clarity, we will assume that you are planning to evaluate for `lab1` in `java` language.


### Setup Solution ###

Setup of a matching gitlab repository is mandatory before a lab evaluation is setup on AutolabJS. Please follow the steps given below to create and setup a lab solution on gitlab.

1. **Gitlab Login**    
    Login to gitlab as `lab_author`. In case you have not created an account with username of `lab_author` before, please do so before going to the next step.

1. **Create repository**    
    Create a gitlab repository for the lab. You can create a new gitlab repository by clicking on _New Project_ button. After successful creation of a project repository, Gitlab creates a URL for the project.    
    For example, `lab1` of `lab_author` hosted at `https://autolab.bits-goa.ac.in` shall have a URL of `https://autolab.bits-goa.ac.in/lab_author/lab1`

1. **Clone repository**    
    Clone the gitlab repository onto your local machine.
    ```shell
    $ export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1
    $ git clone https://lab_author@autolab.bits-goa.ac.in/lab_author/lab1.git
    ```
    This step clones the gitlab repository into _lab1_ directory of the present working directory.

1. **Create skeleton structure**    
   Create the following directory structure in the local copy of git repository.
   ```shell
    author_solution             ---> contains the complete solution to the lab
        /java                   ---> contains Java-language solutions
             /lib               ---> contains any third-party Java libraries you would like to use for evaluation

    test_cases/                 ---> contains testcases to be run against submitted code
        /checks                 ---> any sample input / output text files to be used for evaluation
        /java/                  ---> test cases for Java language
            /setup              ---> compile, execute and test-setup bash shell scripts
                compile.sh      ---> script to compile the code for each test (DON'T CHANGE THIS)
                executeTest.sh  ---> script to execute the code for each test (DON'T CHANGE THIS)
                Test1.sh        ---> script to complete first test (calls compile.sh, executeTest.sh)
                (one script for each test case)
            /tests              ---> contains the java-language test files for each test
                 Test1.java     ---> test file that runs a test. This file is indirectly called by Driver.java
  
    (one language-specific sub-directory exists under test_cases)

    Driver.java                 ---> Language driver for Java (DON'T CHANGE THIS)
    (one driver exists for each language)

    execute.sh                  ---> orchestrating script for one submission (DON'T CHANGE THIS)
    test_info.txt               ---> text file containing an enumeration of all tests to be run
   ```
    You can see the sample directory structure in [unit_tests](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/tree/master/docs/examples/unit_tests). All the files that have **DON'T CHANGE** tag in the above listing have to be copied from [unit_tests](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/tree/master/docs/examples/unit_tests). The other files can be copied and modified according to your needs.

    Inside `author_solution` and `test_cases` directories, there is one language-specific sub-directory. One language-specific driver file exists at the top-level. Please copy the needed driver file(s) from [unit_tests](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/tree/master/docs/examples/unit_tests). You can evaluate C, C++ 2011, C++ 2014, Python2, and Python3 languages.

1. **Evaluation Setup**    
    Apart from the above directory structure, when the evaluation happens three more directories are created by AutolabJS. They are:
    ```shell
    student_solution        ---> the submitted code gets copied here
    working_dir             ---> a temporary directory used during evaluation
    results                 ---> results of evaluation are stored in this directory
        /log.txt            ---> evaluation log is in this file
        /scores.txt         ---> scores received for all the test cases
        /comments.txt       ---> comments received for all the test cases
    ```

1. **Copy the solution**    
    Copy the lab solution into `author_solution/java`. Any required third-party libraries need to be copied to `author_solution/java/lib`.

1. **Create List of Tests**    
    Copy `test_info.txt` from [unit_tests](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/tree/master/docs/examples/unit_tests) and modify to suit your needs. Each line of `test_info.txt` has two fields separated by a tab space. A sample `test_info.txt` with two tests is shown below.        
    ```shell
    Test1	1
    Test2	1
    ```
    The first field corresponds to name of the test and the second field corresponds to time limit to run the test. The last line ends without any new line character.

1. **Write tests**    
    A test should have four matching parts. 
    1. Required solution and library files in `author_solution/java/`
    1. A test setup shell script (ex: test_cases/java/setup/Test1.sh)    
       Each test setup script has a copy section which helps copy the necessary files from `author_solution` and `student_solution` into `working_dir`.
    1. A Java test class (ex: test_cases/java/tests/Test1.java)
    1. An entry in test_info.txt file (ex: Test1    1).    

    Please refer to [unit_tests](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/tree/master/docs/examples/unit_tests) for sample setup.
    Repeat the above mentioned four steps for all the tests

1. **save and export the solutions to gitlab**    
    Make a commit in the local repository and push the changes to the gitlab.    
    ```shell
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m 'instructor's solutions'
    $ git push origin master
    ```

1. Follow the details provided on [Manage Course](https://github.com/AutolabJS/AutolabJS/wiki/v0.2.0-Manage-Course) page to add the lab to website.
