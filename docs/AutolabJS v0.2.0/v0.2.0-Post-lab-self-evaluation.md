**Prerequisites**

1. Following all the steps given here requires availability of the compiler + interpreter of a chosen programming language.    
2. You are using Ubuntu 16.04 Operating System.

**Self Evaluation**    
The steps for self-evaluation are as follows.

1. **Clone the code base**.     
    For the same of illustration, let us assume that your username is 2012A7PS001G and you are interested in self-evaluation for "lab1".
   ```shell
    $git clone https://autolab.bits-goa.ac.in/lab_author/lab1.git
    $git clone https://autolab.bits-goa.ac.in/lab_author/lab1.git 2017A7PS001G
   ```
 
2. Copy your code to **student_solution**.
   ```shell
    $mkdir lab1/student_solution
    $cp 2017A7PS001G/* lab1/student_solution/
   ```

3. **Evaluate  yourself**.    
    ```shell
    $bash execute.sh language-key
    ```
   The languages and their keys are:    
   C - c, C++ 2011 - cpp, C++ 2014 - cpp14, Java - java, Python2 - python2, Python3 - python3    
  
4. The output shall be saved in **results/** directory. The **results/scores.txt** will contain the scores for that submission and **results/logs.txt** will contain the errors encountered during the compilation.
