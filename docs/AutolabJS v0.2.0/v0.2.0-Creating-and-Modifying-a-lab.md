Instructions for writing tests depend on the kind of tests you wish to write for a lab. The available options are:

* [JUnit-based labs](v0.2.0-Creating-Labs-for-JUnit-Tests.md)
* Input-Output (IO) tests using
    * [Source code](v0.2.0-Creating-Labs-for-IO-Tests-with-Source-Code.md)
    * [Compiled binaries](v0.2.0-Creating-Labs-for-IO-Tests-with-Compiled-Binaries.md)

The given example folder contains unit tests for Object Oriented Programming (OOP) course. Source code based IO-tests are from Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course. Compiled binary based IO tests are for Compiler Design course.
