1. I modified the course / lab settings in *admin* section, but the changes are not reflected in the main page. What should I do to reflect the configuration changes?    
*Ans:* Please restart the mainserver container using    
`cd JavaAutolab/deploy`    
`sudo ansible -i inventory mainserver --become --ask-become-pass  -m docker_container -a "name=mainserver  state=started restart=yes"`    

1. I create a lab with non-alphanumeric character in lab name, ex: "dsa-lab1". The Autolab system breaks down.    
*Ans:* The lab names can only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9). A lab name can not start with an integer. Please change the name of the lab in labs.json file either from terminal or from **admin** section. Once the lab name is updated, ask the administrator to restart the relevant autolab components using the commands.
    ```shell
    $sudo docker restart mainserver
    $sudo docker restart loadbalancer
    ```
